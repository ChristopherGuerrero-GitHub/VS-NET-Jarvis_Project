# VS-NET-Jarvis_Project

This program uses speech recognition and synthesizer to interpret a user's comments that Jarvis will
recognize and respond too. Noteaht that a set a user's comments are also saved in a text file that
will be loaded during intialization so Jarvis can understand and find a match with user's comments
with the corresponding response to be spoken.
